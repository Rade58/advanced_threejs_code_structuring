# EventEmitter

I copied from the [gist](https://gist.github.com/brunosimon/120acda915e6629e3a4d497935b16bdf?permalink_comment_id=3964343#gistcomment-3964343)

The EventEmitter can be used for any of your classes that need to trigger
events
• An animation of the model has finished
• An object has been clicked on
• The player is going out of the level
• An ennemy died
Later, we are going to use it to tell the experience that all the resources are
loaded
